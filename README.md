## Abstract
Accurate prediction of the compressive strength of High-Performance Concrete (HPC) is essential for mix proportion optimization and structural safety. However, in small-sample scenarios, deep learning models often face overfitting due to their high parameter count, and may underperform compared to traditional machine learning methods. This study introduces HPC-FLRNet, a compact deep learning model specifically designed for small-sample data. Using a benchmark dataset, HPC1826, which consists of 1,826 mix proportions and their corresponding strengths, the HPC-FLRNet model effectively captures the complex nonlinear relationships between mix proportions and strength, utilizing a combination of input projection, feature refinement, and compression regression. The model’s performance outperforms traditional machine learning models and demonstrates excellent generalization ability, even under limited data conditions.
